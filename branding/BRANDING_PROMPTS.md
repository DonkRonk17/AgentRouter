# AgentRouter Branding Prompts

**For DALL-E 3 Image Generation**

These prompts generate consistent branding for AgentRouter following the Beacon HQ Visual System v1.

---

## PROMPT 1: Title Card (16:9 Landscape)

```
Create a title card image with a 16:9 aspect ratio in a professional tech style with a dark background (#0a0e27 navy).

The main visual should feature an intelligent routing system with multiple AI agent nodes connected by dynamic, glowing routing paths. Show 5 agent nodes arranged in a network, each with a different color (purple, blue, cyan, green, orange), with intelligent routing lines flowing between them based on task type. Include visual elements like decision trees, routing arrows, task classification icons, and optimization indicators.

In the center, show a central routing hub or decision engine with tasks being automatically directed to the optimal agent. Add visual indicators for cost optimization (dollar sign), speed optimization (lightning bolt), and quality optimization (star).

Include the text "AgentRouter" in a modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Inter) in bright cyan (#00d4ff), positioned in the lower third. Add the tagline "Intelligent Task Routing" in smaller white text below it.

Use a color palette of navy blue (#0a0e27), bright cyan (#00d4ff), white (#ffffff), and accent colors for different agents (purple #a855f7, blue #60a5fa, green #4ade80, orange #fb923c). Add subtle tech elements like routing paths, decision nodes, optimization indicators, and a slight grid pattern overlay.

The overall mood should be intelligent, automated, and optimized - conveying smart decision-making and efficient routing.
```

## PROMPT 2: Logo Mark (1:1 Square)

```
Create a square logo icon for an intelligent task routing system called AgentRouter.

The design should feature a stylized routing node or traffic director symbol. Use a dark navy circle (#0a0e27) as the background. In the center, show a minimalist representation of a central hub with multiple colored paths branching out in different directions, representing intelligent routing to different agents.

Use bright cyan (#00d4ff) for the central routing node, with colored paths (purple, blue, green, orange) radiating outward to represent different agents. Add small icons on the paths: a dollar sign for cost, a lightning bolt for speed, and a star for quality.

Add a subtle glow effect around the central routing hub and along the active paths.

The style should be modern, clean, and tech-forward - suitable for an intelligent routing tool. No text in this version - icon only.
```

## PROMPT 3: Horizontal Logo (3:1 Wide)

```
Create a wide horizontal logo banner (3:1 aspect ratio) for AgentRouter.

On the left third, include a stylized icon of a routing hub with multiple colored paths branching to different nodes, representing intelligent task routing to AI agents.

In the center and right sections, display "AgentRouter" in a bold, modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Space Grotesk) in bright cyan (#00d4ff).

Use a dark navy background (#0a0e27) with subtle tech elements like routing paths, decision trees, and optimization indicators flowing through the design. The routing icon should have a slight glow effect in cyan, with colored paths (purple, blue, green, orange) representing different agents.

Below or integrated with the text, add small icons for the three optimization modes: a dollar sign (cost), lightning bolt (speed), and star (quality).

Professional, clean, tech-forward style suitable for GitHub headers and documentation.
```

## PROMPT 4: App Icon (1:1 Square, Simplified)

```
Create a simple, bold app icon (1:1 square) for AgentRouter that works at small sizes.

Design a minimalist icon featuring a routing symbol or traffic director. Use a dark navy (#0a0e27) to bright cyan (#00d4ff) gradient as the background. The main symbol should be a simple, geometric hub or node with 4-6 paths radiating outward in different directions.

Use white for the central hub and colored paths (purple, blue, green, orange) for the outgoing routes, representing routing to different agents.

Keep it very simple and bold - it should be recognizable even at 32x32 pixels. Modern, flat design style with subtle depth (maybe a slight shadow or gradient on the hub).

No text - icon only. Clean, professional, instantly recognizable as an intelligent routing/decision tool.
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
1. Forge requested this tool for intelligent task routing in Team Brain
2. The design should emphasize automation, intelligence, and optimization
3. All images should work well on dark backgrounds (GitHub)
4. Maintain consistency with other Beacon HQ tools (tech-forward aesthetic)
5. Key concept: Smart routing to the right agent for the job
